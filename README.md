# Pwnz-s-VC-Utility
In order to run this you need dotnet framework 4.5 minimum. 

I realize I'm pretty bad at coding because im just starting out, but I figured it would be nice to have an all in one utility to help newbies or returning veterans alike. 
I'm not related to the vompany that created vc but I started in 2013 or so and I figured I should contribute sooner or later.

The application still has no icons and is pretty ugly but it's the bare minimum for now at 60 kb. I wanted to include pictures but im not so sure about copyright issues.
